## Google Data Analytics Project

The aim of this project was to analyze fitness tracking data from the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data to identify trends and patterns in smart device usage and relate these to Bellabeat's products to improve their marketing strategy and overall business growth. Using Google's 6 step data analytics process, we asked relevant questions about the data, prepared and processed the dataset using RStudio, analyzed the data, and shared our findings and recommendations with the Bellabeat stakeholders.
